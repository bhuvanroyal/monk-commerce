# üßæ Monk Commerce ‚Äì Coupon Service

## üè∑Ô∏è Overview
This project is part of the **Monk Commerce Backend Assignment**, built to manage and apply different types of coupons in an e-commerce platform.  
It supports three main coupon types:
- **Cart-wise Coupon**  
- **Product-wise Coupon**  
- **BxGy Coupon (Buy X Get Y Free)**

  ## üöÄ API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **POST** | `/coupons` | Create a new coupon (cart-wise, product-wise, or bxgy) |
| **GET** | `/coupons` | Retrieve all coupons |
| **GET** | `/coupons/{id}` | Retrieve a specific coupon |
| **PUT** | `/coupons/{id}` | Update an existing coupon |
| **DELETE** | `/coupons/{id}` | Delete a coupon |
| **POST** | `/applicable-coupons` | Get list of applicable coupons for a given cart |
| **POST** | `/apply-coupon/{id}` | Apply a coupon and return updated cart details |

## üß© Implemented Cases

### üü¢ 1. Cart-wise Coupon
Applies a percentage discount to the **entire cart total** if it exceeds a specified threshold.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "cart-wise",
  "details": {
    "threshold": 100,
    "discount": 10
  }
} 
```
### üü¢ 2. Product-wise Coupon

Applies a discount on specific product(s) in the cart.

Example:
```json
{
  "type": "product-wise",
  "details": {
    "product_id": 1,
    "discount": 20
  }
}
```
üí° If product #1 costs ‚Çπ100 √ó 3 ‚Üí discount = ‚Çπ60.

### üü¢ 3. BxGy Coupon (Buy X Get Y Free)

Buy certain quantities of products from one list and get other products for free.

Example:
```json
{
  "type": "bxgy",
  "details": {
    "buy_products": [
      {"product_id": 1, "quantity": 2},
      {"product_id": 2, "quantity": 2}
    ],
    "get_products": [
      {"product_id": 3, "quantity": 1}
    ],
    "repition_limit": 3
  }
}
```
üí° Buying 6 units of Product 1 ‚Üí get 3 units of Product 3 free (worth ‚Çπ75).

### Limitations

1. Product catalog data is not stored; pricing comes directly from cart request.
2. BxGy assumes same quantity rule for all buy-products.
3. No concurrency or transaction handling beyond basic persistence.
4. Single-table inheritance could become heavy if coupon types increase.
5. No API authentication or authorization layer included.
6. Currency assumed to be INR.
7. Basic error responses ‚Äî no custom exception structure yet.

### Assumptions

1. type field in requests is always valid (cart-wise, product-wise, bxgy).
2. Product IDs in cart are valid and unique.
3. All prices are in INR and positive numbers.
4. Each coupon can also have a unique code like SAVE10 or B2G1FREE.
5. Free items in BxGy are added to the same product‚Äôs quantity instead of separate items.
6. Future improvement: Introduce a data-driven rule engine allowing marketing teams to create new coupon types dynamically without code changes.
